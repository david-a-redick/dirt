[Annex: Conquer the World](https://bitbucket.org/annexctw/annex/src/master/)
a RTS game based on the [MegaGlest](https://github.com/MegaGlest) engine.

The primary hurdle is the current megaglest package in debian should be
split into a megaglest-engine and megaglest/megaglest-game so that
annex can be installed without the megaglest game data.

See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=768200

* The rain effect on the menu screen seems to be a bug and annex should turn it off.
